# Standard: DESIGN_SYSTEM

> **Stability:** v1.6.0
> **Principle:** every archetype A app shares the **same visual contract**: the same theme, the same spacing rhythm, the same icon source, the same localisation mechanism, the same error-and-progress surfaces. Internal STEM tooling reads as one product family even when each app is a separate repo. Brand assets (corporate palette / typography / logo) follow once received from STEM; until then the design system is anchored to neutral Fluent defaults.
> **Applies to:** archetype A.
> **Pairs with:** [`GUI.md`](./GUI.md). `GUI` governs project shape and the MVU paradigm; this standard governs everything the user sees inside that shape.

## Reference

`Avalonia.Themes.Fluent` (theme), `FluentIcons.Avalonia.Fluent` (iconography). Both pinned via the templates' `Directory.Packages.props`. F# strings module for localisation — no external runtime, no `.resx`, no JSON dictionaries.

## Theme

- **Base:** `FluentTheme` from `Avalonia.Themes.Fluent`. No `SimpleTheme`, no third-party theme packs.
- **Mode:** **light mode is the default at first launch.** The Stem brand manual is entirely light-canvas — there is no sanctioned dark palette. Light mode adheres to the brand; dark mode is a **software-only convention** offered for long engineer sessions and low-light production bays, using derived shades that fall outside the brand's sanctioned Cool Gray range (10–60%). The user can toggle; the choice is persisted to settings per [`CONFIGURATION.md`](./CONFIGURATION.md).
- The active mode lives on the top-level `Model` (`type ThemeMode = Light | Dark`) and is applied at `App.fs` startup via `RequestedThemeVariant`.

```fsharp
// in App.fs
override this.Initialize () =
    base.Initialize ()
    this.Styles.Add (FluentTheme ())
    this.RequestedThemeVariant <- ThemeVariant.Light
```

## Palette

The Stem brand manual (`Manuale del brand`) is the print-side source of truth. This section is the software-side mirror: every brand-sanctioned color exposed as a named token, plus a small set of software-derived tokens for UI semantics the brand manual does not cover.

### Brand tokens — per-app `Brand` module

Each archetype A app declares a `Brand` module that exposes the brand-sanctioned colors as `Avalonia.Media.Color` values. **No view ever uses a hex literal** — references go through this module.

```fsharp
module Stem.<App>.GUI.Brand

open Avalonia.Media

// Primary (corporate identity, all divisions)
let BluStem        = Color.Parse "#004483"   // Pantone 2154 C

// Blu Stem sanctioned tints
let BluStem30      = Color.Parse "#B1C9F8"   // Pantone 658 C — icon tint paired with Blu Stem
let BluStem40      = Color.Parse "#7BA5E9"   // Pantone 659 C — secondary text
let BluStem60      = Color.Parse "#407ED4"   // Pantone 660 C — secondary text

// Cool Gray ramp — sanctioned range is 10% to 60% only.
// Pure black (#000) and pure white (#FFF) for body text are off-brand.
let Gray10         = Color.Parse "#D9DAE4"   // Pantone Cool Gray 1C
let Gray20         = Color.Parse "#C9CAD4"   // Pantone Cool Gray 3C
let Gray30         = Color.Parse "#B2B4BE"   // Pantone Cool Gray 5C
let Gray40         = Color.Parse "#989AA5"   // Pantone Cool Gray 7C
let Gray60         = Color.Parse "#757982"   // Pantone Cool Gray 9C — darkest sanctioned neutral

// Alert — the brand's only sanctioned warm color in the primary palette
let RossoAlert     = Color.Parse "#E40032"   // Pantone 185 C — alerts, warnings, key features

// Division identity colors (used by Branding.badge, not as primary chrome)
let VerdeEMS                  = Color.Parse "#98D801"   // Pantone 375 C
let GialloCommercialVehicles  = Color.Parse "#FFC04A"   // Pantone 136 C
let AzzurroMarine             = Color.Parse "#00B6ED"   // Pantone 306 C

// Stem France branch (used only by France-targeted apps)
let BluFrance      = Color.Parse "#0031A7"   // Pantone 286 C
let Bianco         = Color.Parse "#F5F5F5"
```

### Software-derived semantic tokens

The brand manual does not define a software UI semantic palette. The four tokens below are **software conventions**, distinct from brand-identity colors so they don't collide:

```fsharp
module Stem.<App>.GUI.Brand.Semantic

open Avalonia.Media
open Stem.<App>.GUI.Brand

let Info    = BluStem                          // brand-aligned
let Success = Color.Parse "#16A34A"            // forest green — distinct from VerdeEMS
let Warning = Color.Parse "#D97706"            // orange-amber — distinct from GialloCommercialVehicles
let Error   = RossoAlert                       // brand-aligned (Pantone 185 C)
```

- **Error** reuses `RossoAlert` because the brand manual itself sanctions red for "alerts, warnings, key features" — the alignment is meaningful.
- **Success** picks a forest green visibly distinct from `VerdeEMS` (`#98D801`) so a "saved successfully" toast in an EMS app cannot be mistaken for a division-identity marker. The same reasoning constrains **Warning**.
- **Info** reuses `BluStem` — the primary identity color is the natural carrier for neutral-informational accents.

These four tokens are the ones consumed by the error-and-progress surfaces below. They never appear in chrome; the chrome uses `BluStem` plus the Cool Gray ramp.

### Color usage rules (from the brand manual)

These rules are load-bearing — they constrain what views can compose.

1. **Primary blue can be solid or gradient.** The blu↔white gradient is sanctioned. Software hover / selected / focus states can lean on the `BluStem30/40/60` tints without violating the brand.
2. **Division colors never pair with each other.** Verde EMS + Giallo CV in the same view reads as cross-division marketing and is brand-illegal. Inside any one app, only **one** division's identity color appears — see `Branding` below.
3. **Cool Gray range is 10% to 60% only.** No `#000000`. No `#FFFFFF` for body text (use `Bianco` `#F5F5F5` for canvas). Body text on a light canvas defaults to `Gray60` (`#757982`); on a Blu Stem surface, body text defaults to `Bianco`.
4. **Red is the alert / key-emphasis color.** Sanctioned for warnings, alerts, stickers, key-concept call-outs. Software co-opts this for `Semantic.Error`.

## Division badging — per-app `Branding` module

Each archetype A app declares which Stem division it primarily serves. The division identity color appears **only** in the badge surface — never in chrome (title bar, primary buttons, navigation accent, hover states).

```fsharp
module Stem.<App>.GUI.Branding

open Avalonia.Media
open Stem.<App>.GUI.Brand

type Division =
    | None                 // corporate / cross-division tool
    | EMS
    | CommercialVehicles
    | Marine
    | France               // branch, not a division — uses BluFrance + flag colors

let division : Division = EMS   // edit per app

let badgeColor : Color =
    match division with
    | None               -> BluStem
    | EMS                -> VerdeEMS
    | CommercialVehicles -> GialloCommercialVehicles
    | Marine             -> AzzurroMarine
    | France             -> BluFrance

let badgeLabel : string =
    match division with
    | None               -> "Stem"
    | EMS                -> "Stem EMS"
    | CommercialVehicles -> "Stem Commercial Vehicles"
    | Marine             -> "Stem Marine"
    | France             -> "Stem France"
```

**Where the badge appears:**

- A small division mark next to the corporate brand mark in the title bar (e.g. `[Stem] [EMS]`).
- A divider color (`Branding.badgeColor`) on division-tagged rows in lists when the app spans multiple divisions (`stem-dictionaries-manager` is the canonical case).
- The About dialog (corporate brand mark + division badge + version).

**Where the badge does *not* appear:**

- Title bar background (stays `Bianco` light / derived dark in dark mode).
- Primary button fill (`BluStem`).
- Hover / focus / selected states (`BluStem` tints).
- Page-content backgrounds.

This keeps the app reading as a **Stem corporate tool** that happens to support a specific division, rather than a division-only product — matching how the brand manual structures the hierarchy.

## Typography

The brand body font is **Poppins** (Google Fonts, SIL OFL — free to bundle and ship). It is the only font archetype A apps use.

```fsharp
module Stem.<App>.GUI.Typography

let fontFamily   = "Poppins"        // exposed as a string for FuncUI

// Weights — every weight ships in Resources/fonts/
let regular      = FontWeight.Regular   // 400 — body text
let medium       = FontWeight.Medium    // 500 — UI labels
let semiBold     = FontWeight.SemiBold  // 600 — buttons, table headers
let bold         = FontWeight.Bold      // 700 — titles, section headers
let light        = FontWeight.Light     // 300 — tertiary text, captions

// Type scale (Avalonia FontSize values)
let body         = 14.0
let bodySmall    = 12.0
let label        = 13.0
let button       = 14.0
let h3           = 16.0    // sub-section
let h2           = 20.0    // section
let h1           = 28.0    // page title
let display      = 40.0    // empty-state hero text
```

**Bundling:** ship Poppins in `Resources/fonts/Poppins-*.ttf` (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, Light) and register the family as the default at `AppBuilder` time in `Program.fs`:

```fsharp
// DictionariesManager.GUI/Program.fs
open Avalonia
open Avalonia.Media
open System

[<EntryPoint; STAThread>]
let main argv =
    AppBuilder
        .Configure<App>(fun () -> App())
        .UsePlatformDetect()
        .With(FontManagerOptions(DefaultFamilyName =
            "avares://Stem.<App>.GUI/Resources/fonts/#Poppins"))
        .StartWithClassicDesktopLifetime(argv)
```

`FontManagerOptions` lives in **`Avalonia.Media`**, not `Avalonia.Media.Fonts` — the namespace mistake is the first thing autocomplete suggests.

- *For XAML hosts (archetype B / hosted scenarios).* The same family resolves via an `Application.Resources` entry, kept as a sub-form rather than the default:

  ```xml
  <Application.Resources>
      <FontFamily x:Key="StemFontFamily">avares://Stem.&lt;App&gt;.GUI/Resources/fonts/#Poppins</FontFamily>
  </Application.Resources>
  ```

The Stem-Regular custom font from the brand manual is **not** used in software — it is reserved for division wordmarks inside the print/marketing brand mark and ships as part of the corporate logo SVG (rendered, not loaded as a font).

## Logo

The corporate brand mark, division marks, and app icons ship as SVG + PNG pairs under `Resources/branding/`. The archetype A rollout drops the full library into each adopted repo at bootstrap (and on every bump), so views can reference any treatment by relative path without per-repo asset wrangling.

```
Resources/branding/
├── brand-marks/                   full lockup (simbolo + "Stem" + optional division wordmark)
│   ├── positive/                  full-colour on light canvas
│   │   ├── stem-corporate.{svg,png}
│   │   ├── stem-ems.{svg,png}
│   │   ├── stem-commercial-vehicles.{svg,png}
│   │   └── stem-marine.{svg,png}
│   ├── negative/                  full-colour on dark / image canvas (white wordmark)
│   │   └── … same four divisions
│   └── mono-white/                single-colour white-out for printing or photo overlays
│       └── … same four divisions
├── symbols/                       simbolo only (sanctioned standalone use, tavola 21)
│   ├── positive/
│   ├── negative/
│   └── mono-white/
│       └── … same four divisions each
└── app-icons/                     square 512 px Windows / macOS / Linux app icon
    ├── stem-app-icon-positive.{svg,png}
    └── stem-app-icon-mono-white.{svg,png}
```

Per-app, `Branding.division` (defined above) selects which division's brand mark to render. The fill colour of every positive SVG is **`#004483`** — the agency's authoritative Blu Stem for the brand mark, matching the palette token (`BluStem = #004483`) per Pantone 2154 C. Don't tint or recolour the SVG fills per-app.

**Symbol-only standalone.** Tavola 21 of the brand manual sanctions the simbolo as a standalone mark when the full lockup is too dense for the surface (favicons, small toolbar slots, watermark stamps). Views may use anything under `symbols/` without pairing it to a `brand-marks/` lockup; both directories are first-class.

**Application rules.** When to use **positive** vs **negative** vs **mono-white**, minimum clear-space around the mark, minimum legible size, and contrast requirements against photographic backgrounds are all defined in the brand manual's tavolas **28–50** (per-division application rules, with corporate covering tavolas 28–32 and each division 33–50). These rules apply to the splash, About dialog, app icon, and any print export the app produces. They do not constrain in-app chrome — chrome uses palette tokens, not rendered brand marks.

**Asset source.** The bundle is shipped from this standards repo's `shared/templates/archetypes/A/src/DictionariesManager.GUI/Resources/branding/`. The rollout script copies it byte-identical via the same archetype A overlay path the Poppins fonts use — `.svg` is on the no-substitute extensions list, so the rollout treats the assets as binary (no LF normalization, no `{{Placeholder}}` scan). Cropping or re-tinting a brand mark for app-specific reasons is **not** allowed; if a treatment is missing, the fix is to expand this bundle upstream rather than to hand-edit assets per repo.

**Brand manual.** The full brand manual (`stem-brand-manual.pdf`) is checked into the standards repo at [`shared/brand-manual/stem-brand-manual.pdf`](../brand-manual/stem-brand-manual.pdf). It is **not** propagated to adopted repos — it is reference material for designers and reviewers, not a runtime asset.

**Stem France.** The Stem France filiale (tavolas 14–15, 26–27, 46–50) is intentionally not shipped in v1.6.0. The `Branding.Division.France` case continues to render `BluFrance` as a badge colour, but no France brand-mark assets exist under `branding/` yet. A future bump will land them when the first France-targeted app earns its keep.

## App-icon wiring (archetype A, Windows)

The bundle ships `stem-app-icon-positive.ico` and `stem-app-icon-mono-white.ico` under `Resources/branding/app-icons/` since **v1.7.1**, generated from the matching SVG masters by [`eng/New-StemAppIcon.ps1`](../../eng/New-StemAppIcon.ps1) (4-frame 16/32/48/256 px, alpha-verified). The `<AvaloniaResource>` glob landed in v1.7.0 (#100).

The same `.ico` file feeds two unrelated Windows surfaces through two independent delivery channels. Both channels must be wired or the `.ico` will only show up in one place.

| Surface | Source | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.exe` shell icon (Explorer, file thumbnails, taskbar pin to the binary) | `Resources/branding/app-icons/stem-app-icon-positive.ico` | `<ApplicationIcon>` MSBuild property — bakes the icon into the PE resource block at build time |
| Title-bar + taskbar (running window) | Same `.ico`, via `avares://` | `<AvaloniaResource>` glob (per-app `.fsproj`) + `WindowIcon(stream)` at runtime |
| Alt-Tab thumbnail | Same `.ico`, via `avares://` | Same as title-bar — Windows picks the 256 px frame from the multi-frame `.ico` |

```xml
<!-- Stem.<App>.GUI/Stem.<App>.GUI.fsproj -->
<PropertyGroup>
    <ApplicationIcon>Resources/branding/app-icons/stem-app-icon-positive.ico</ApplicationIcon>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
    <!-- Plus the fonts / brand-marks globs (see Logo above). The `.ico` glob
         was added to the archetype A scaffold so the runtime channel resolves
         out of the box. -->
    <AvaloniaResource Include="Resources/branding/app-icons/*.ico" />
</ItemGroup>
```

```fsharp
open System
open Avalonia.Controls
open Avalonia.Platform

let private appIconUri =
    Uri "avares://Stem.<App>.GUI/Resources/branding/app-icons/stem-app-icon-positive.ico"

let windowIcon () : WindowIcon =
    use stream = AssetLoader.Open appIconUri
    WindowIcon stream

// in the MainWindow constructor (or wherever the Window is built):
this.Icon <- windowIcon ()
```

**Don't** call `WindowIcon(Bitmap(stream))` against a single oversize PNG (e.g. the 2134 × 2134 agency master). Skia downsamples a 2000+ px raster to a 16 px target in one step, which aliases visibly on the title bar and taskbar. The multi-frame `.ico` (16 / 32 / 48 / 256 px) lets Windows pick the matching pre-rendered frame per surface — crisp at every size.

The `.ico` glob (`Resources/branding/app-icons/*.ico`) is part of the scaffold's [`<AvaloniaResource>` ItemGroup](#logo) so the avares:// channel resolves immediately on bootstrap. `<ApplicationIcon>` stays per-app — different apps may want to point at different `.ico` files under `app-icons/`.

## Spacing

A 4-pt grid spans the whole app. Use named constants from a per-app `Spacing` module — no magic numbers in the view DSL.

```fsharp
module Stem.<App>.GUI.Spacing

let xs   = 4.0      // hairline padding, tight stacks
let sm   = 8.0      // standard control padding
let md   = 12.0     // grouped-control spacing
let lg   = 16.0     // section padding
let xl   = 24.0     // page margins
let xxl  = 32.0     // page-section breaks
let xxxl = 56.0     // hero / dialog padding
let huge = 80.0     // full-bleed splash
```

Stack with `StackPanel.spacing Spacing.md`; pad with `Border.padding (Thickness Spacing.lg)`. Never pass a literal `8.0` or `12.0` into a layout primitive — if a value isn't in the scale, propose adding it to `Spacing` rather than inlining.

## Iconography

- **Source:** `FluentIcons.Avalonia.Fluent` (Microsoft's open-source Fluent System Icons, MIT licensed). Provides ~2000 icons in regular and filled variants, paired natively with the Fluent theme.
- **Usage from FuncUI:**

  ```fsharp
  open FluentIcons.Avalonia.Fluent
  open FluentIcons.Common

  SymbolIcon.create [
      SymbolIcon.symbol Symbol.Save
      SymbolIcon.iconVariant IconVariant.Regular
      SymbolIcon.fontSize 20.0
  ]
  ```

- **Sizing:** icons match the surrounding text's `FontSize`. Toolbar icons default to `20`, in-line icons to `16`, hero icons (empty states) to `48`.
- **Filled vs regular:** regular for navigation and idle affordances; filled for selected / active / destructive states. Pick one of the two within a row — never mix.
- **Tinting:** default to `Brand.Gray60` on light canvas and `Bianco` on Blu Stem chrome. Icons paired with a Blu Stem surface use `Brand.BluStem30` (`#B1C9F8`, Pantone 658 C) per the brand manual's sanctioned icon tint.
- **Custom icons:** when the Fluent catalogue genuinely lacks a glyph (device-specific schematics, Stem hardware silhouettes), drop an SVG into `Resources/icons/` and expose it through a typed `Icons` module. Avoid raster formats; SVG only.

## Localisation (i18n)

Every archetype A app ships **Italian** (default at runtime) **and English** translations. No app is single-language. No string ever sits inline in a view — every visible word lives in `Strings.fs`.

### Mechanism — F# strings module

```fsharp
module Stem.<App>.GUI.Strings

type Lang = It | En

let welcome (lang: Lang) =
    match lang with
    | It -> "Benvenuto"
    | En -> "Welcome"

let deviceConnected (lang: Lang) =
    match lang with
    | It -> "Dispositivo collegato"
    | En -> "Device connected"

let devicesFound (count: int) (lang: Lang) =
    match lang with
    | It -> sprintf "%d dispositivi trovati" count
    | En -> sprintf "%d devices found" count
```

The view consumes by passing the current `Lang` from the `Model`:

```fsharp
TextBlock.create [
    TextBlock.text (Strings.welcome model.Lang)
]
```

### Why F# strings module, not `.resx`

- **Compile-time completeness.** Adding a new language is one new DU case; the compiler then refuses to build until every string function handles it. Adding a new string forces an `It` and `En` value at the declaration site. Missing translations are impossible.
- **Refactor-safe.** Renaming a string is a rename across the project — no XML keys to chase, no `Resources.Designer.cs` to regenerate, no runtime `null` from a missing lookup.
- **MVU-native.** Strings are values, not resource-manager lookups. `Update` and `View` consume them the same way they consume any other model field.
- **No external tooling.** Translators receive a `Strings.fs` patch on a PR; the diff reads as prose paired by case. There is no ResX Manager dependency, no Crowdin pipeline, no key-mismatch class of bug.

### Default language at runtime

`Lang.It` is the startup default. The first-run experience offers a language picker in the title bar; the choice is persisted per [`CONFIGURATION.md`](./CONFIGURATION.md). The active value lives on the top-level `Model.Lang`.

### Italian-first content rules

- **Seed data stays Italian.** Variables, protocol dictionaries, and other domain data are *data*, not UI chrome — they ship in whatever language STEM uses internally (typically Italian for legacy dictionaries) and are not translated by the strings module.
- **UI chrome translates.** Every label, button, error message, toast, modal heading, and tab title goes through `Strings.fs`.
- **Logs stay English** per [`LOGGING.md`](./LOGGING.md) and the `COMMENTS.md` English-by-default rule. The strings module is the user-facing surface, not the diagnostic one.

## Error and progress surfaces

Four surfaces, each with a defined role. Pick by the decision tree, not by feel.

| Surface | When to use | Lifetime | Blocks input? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Toast** | Non-critical info, success confirmation, recoverable warning | Auto-dismiss after 4–8 s | No |
| **Banner** | Persistent condition the user should be aware of (offline mode, stale data, pending update) | Until condition clears or user dismisses | No |
| **Inline error** | Validation failure attached to a specific control | Until the user corrects the input | No |
| **Modal** | Destructive confirmation, unrecoverable error, mandatory acknowledgement | Until the user acknowledges | Yes |

### Decision tree

1. Does the user need to *do* something before the app can proceed? → **modal**.
2. Is the error tied to one input field? → **inline error** beside that control.
3. Is the condition ongoing (not a one-shot event)? → **banner**.
4. Otherwise → **toast**.

### Payload shape

All four surfaces consume the same `ErrorPayload` record produced upstream per [`ERROR_HANDLING.md`](./ERROR_HANDLING.md):

```fsharp
type Severity = Info | Success | Warning | Error

type ErrorPayload = {
    Severity: Severity
    Title:    Lang -> string
    Body:     Lang -> string
    Action:   (Lang -> string) option   // optional "Retry" / "View details" label
    OnAction: Msg option                 // dispatched if Action is invoked
}
```

The `Title` and `Body` carry localised functions, not pre-rendered strings — the surface renders them with the current `Model.Lang`, so a language switch mid-toast re-renders correctly.

### Semantic colours

Each severity maps to a token from `Brand.Semantic`:

| Severity | Token | Hex | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Info` | `Brand.Semantic.Info` | `#004483` | brand `BluStem` (Pantone 2154 C) |
| `Success` | `Brand.Semantic.Success` | `#16A34A` | software-derived — distinct from `VerdeEMS` to prevent division-color collision |
| `Warning` | `Brand.Semantic.Warning` | `#D97706` | software-derived — distinct from `GialloCommercialVehicles` to prevent division-color collision |
| `Error` | `Brand.Semantic.Error` | `#E40032` | brand `RossoAlert` (Pantone 185 C — sanctioned alert color) |

Severity is never communicated by color alone — every surface pairs the color with a matching `SymbolIcon` (`Symbol.Info`, `Symbol.CheckmarkCircle`, `Symbol.Warning`, `Symbol.DismissCircle`) so the signal carries on grayscale screens, in colorblind contexts, and on accessibility tooling.

## Loading and progress

- **Inline spinner** for small async ops (single-row save, validation round-trip). Sits on the control itself.
- **Top-of-view progress bar** (`ProgressBar.isIndeterminate true`) for page transitions and content loads.
- **Skeleton loaders** for content-heavy pages (variable tables, log views) — preserves layout while data streams in.
- **Cancel affordance.** When the operation is long-running and cancellable per [`CANCELLATION.md`](./CANCELLATION.md), the surface exposes a visible **Cancel** button (toast action / banner button / modal button). Operations without a Cancel affordance are not allowed to run more than ~2 s.

## Window sizing and DPI

- **Minimum window size:** `1024 × 600`. Engineers run these tools on docked laptops and production-floor workstations; below this size column-dense tables collapse beyond usability.
- **Per-monitor DPI awareness:** on by default via Avalonia. No fixed-pixel positioning — use `Grid` with proportional rows/columns, or `DockPanel`, or `StackPanel` plus the `Spacing` scale.
- **High-DPI assets:** SVG icons (Fluent System Icons + custom) scale natively; raster assets in `Resources/` ship at 1×, 2×, and 3× via Avalonia's `.assets` convention.

## Accessibility floor

Minimum requirements every archetype A app meets:

- **Keyboard navigation:** every interactive control is reachable by Tab; tab order matches visual reading order.
- **Focus indicator:** the Fluent default focus ring stays on. Don't strip it for visual reasons.
- **Contrast:** body text meets WCAG AA against its background in both themes. Verify via Avalonia DevTools' contrast checker during page review.
- **Touch targets:** minimum 44 × 44 px when running on a touchscreen workstation (production floor). Critical actions get explicit hit-test padding.

Production-floor touchscreens are real deployment targets for some apps — design with mouse and finger in mind from the start, not as a retrofit.

## What this means in practice

- **Adding a string:** edit `Strings.fs`, the compiler reminds you to fill `It` and `En`. View consumes via `Strings.<name> model.Lang`.
- **Adding a colour:** use a `Brand.*` token (or `Brand.Semantic.*` for status colour). Never a hex literal in the view DSL.
- **Adding an icon:** import from `FluentIcons.Common.Symbol` and pick. Custom SVG only when the Fluent set genuinely lacks the glyph. Tint defaults to `Brand.Gray60`; on Blu Stem surfaces, tint to `Brand.BluStem30`.
- **Reporting an error:** build an `ErrorPayload` upstream; route to the right surface via the decision tree. Don't `printfn` a user-facing string and call it a day.
- **Choosing a spacing value:** read from `Stem.<App>.GUI.Spacing`. If the value you need is missing, add it to `Spacing` (and consider whether it should land here as a new scale step).
- **Setting a new app's division:** edit `Branding.division` once at app scaffolding. The badge, badge color, and About-dialog branding follow.
- **Pairing colors in a view:** brand-illegal combinations to avoid — two division colors in the same view (e.g. Verde EMS + Giallo CV); pure black or white for body text (use `Gray60` / `Bianco`).
